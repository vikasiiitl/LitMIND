"""Numerous studies have addressed this topic with varying approaches. The paper introduces PLUS, a semi-automated pipeline designed to detect fraud in public bids, featuring a heuristic meta-classifier and a data quality module. PLUS has shown promising results in reducing the workload of specialists by automating fraud and overpricing detection in public bidding documents.""Gabardo & Lopes investigated the use of social network analysis and complex network techniques to identify cartel-like structures in public bids, aiming to expose fraudulent groupings and their impact on bid outcomes, thereby preventing public fund misuse [1]. Brand√£o et al. developed PLUS, a semi-automated pipeline utilizing a heuristic meta-classifier and data quality module to enhance fraud detection in public bids. This system streamlines data processing from diverse sources, improves transparency, and reduces manual workload, thereby increasing efficiency in detecting irregularities [2]. Arana-Catania et al. investigated the use of NLP and machine learning to enhance citizen engagement on digital platforms like ""Decide Madrid."" Their project aims to improve democratic participation by suggesting proposals, summarizing comments, and facilitating proposal development, showing that these technologies can significantly enhance user experience and participation effectiveness [3]. Oliveira & Silveira conducted a systematic review on open government data in Brazil, focusing on politicians' expenses and education investments. The study highlights challenges like data treatment and infrastructure needs, recommending improvements for data accessibility and use [4]. Hsieh et al. proposed the LSTMEnsembler framework, integrating LSTM with classifiers like XGBoost, LightGBM, TextCNN, and BERT to predict mediation outcomes using case properties and textual data, achieving an 85.6% F-measure [5]. Brito et al. discuss the integration of heterogeneous government open data in Brazil, emphasizing challenges like data quality and lack of documentation. They highlight two contest-winning applications that enhance service delivery and promote transparency [6]."
