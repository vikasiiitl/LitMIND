"Numerous studies have addressed the use of semantic computing to enhance public access to digital cultural heritage. This paper explores how institutions like museums in Europe utilize these technologies to aid in data analysis and make archaeological collections more accessible, with a focus on Finland's CoinSampo framework.Dobat et al. discuss the DIME project, launched in September 2018, which promotes inclusive heritage management by facilitating public recording of metal detector finds in Denmark, integrating citizen science and crowdsourcing into museum practices [1]. Immonen and Kinnunen's longitudinal survey from Finland shows metal detecting evolving into an organized hobby through registered associations, highlighting its role in civil society and heritage management [2]. Deckers et al. review the state and impact of non-professional archaeological metal-detecting in Europe, aiming to foster a unified debate and establish ethical guidelines across national boundaries within professional archaeology and heritage management [3]. Deckers et al. discuss the state and impact of non-professional archaeological metal-detecting in Europe, aiming to foster a unified debate and establish common ethical guidelines and best practices across national boundaries in professional archaeology and heritage management [4]. Nomisma.org, initiated by the American Numismatic Society in 2010, revolutionized numismatics using Semantic Web and Linked Open Data, enhancing data exchange and accessibility in numismatics and archaeology [5]. Ferguson et al. discuss the dual impact of hobbyist metal detecting on battlefield archaeology, highlighting its contributions and the ethical, legal challenges it poses, advocating for responsible collaboration [6]. Oksanen et al. discuss how new semantic computing technologies, through the CoinSampo framework in Finland, democratize access to digital cultural heritage, particularly archaeological and numismatic data, for both professionals and non-professionals, fostering participatory heritage approaches [7]. The text discusses a pragmatic approach to managing portable antiquities in England and Wales, focusing on balancing interests of archaeologists, collectors, and the public, while addressing legal and ethical issues [8]. Dobat et al. discuss the European Public Finds Recording Network (EPFRN), which promotes responsible metal detecting and data sharing to create a comprehensive historical database across Europe [9]. Metal detecting is popular in the Czech Republic, with many enthusiasts drawn to its historical and archaeological aspects. Professional archaeologists recognize the importance of finds and advocate for collaboration through projects like ""Joint Forces,"" which promotes citizen science and includes a digital platform for registering finds [10]. Cooper and Green discuss utilizing composite object assemblages to analyze large, complex datasets, addressing spatial and temporal dimensions for extracting meaningful insights [11]. Daubney & Nicholas investigate illicit metal detecting in England and Wales, highlighting over 1.3 million finds recorded by the Portable Antiquities Scheme since 1997. They emphasize the need for better police record-keeping to address underreporting and improve understanding of heritage crime trends [12]. Holland-Lulewicz et al. discuss the shift in Eastern North American archaeology from categorical to relational perspectives, emphasizing the agential power of relationships in shaping social, political, and economic phenomena, enabling a deeper understanding of archaeological narratives [13]. Wessman et al. discussed the FindSampo and SuALT projects, which integrate digital archaeology with citizen science to enhance public participation and data collection in archaeological research [14]. Dobat et al. investigated how metal detector archaeology aids British Armed Forces veterans with mental health issues, focusing on a 50-year-old male veteran who alleviated his PTSD and depression through the activity [15]. Cooper and Green investigate the use of 'big data' in archaeology through the English Landscape and Identities project, revealing new insights into historical landscapes and identities in England [16]. Deckers et al. investigated ritual performance, gender transgression, and iconographic innovation in Viking-Age Ribe, challenging traditional narratives and revealing a complex societal structure with dynamic cultural expressions [17]. Axelsen et al. discuss the varying collaboration and communication between hobby metal detectorists and archaeologists in Norway, highlighting discrepancies due to individual and regional differences. They advocate for a national reporting system to standardize practices and ensure fair treatment [18]. Archaeologists and metal-detectorists in England and Wales collaborate through the Portable Antiquities Scheme, yet face unresolved issues. This paper discusses the impact of Treasure law reforms and explores potential solutions to enhance this relationship [19]. The provided text lacks substantive content from the research paper, containing only copyright and bibliographic information. For a detailed summary, please provide the abstract or main content of the paper [20]. Carpentier et al. discussed the Portable Antiquities of the Netherlands (PAN), an online system launched in 2016 for public documentation of archaeological finds. PAN has recorded over 100,000 finds, significantly enriching Dutch archaeology and aiding policy decisions while addressing data quality issues [21]. Tolle & Wigg-Wolf developed rules to enhance data quality in the Antike Fundm√ºnzen in Europa database by detecting and correcting inconsistencies using the Nomisma.org approach, significantly improving trust across numismatic datasets [22]."
