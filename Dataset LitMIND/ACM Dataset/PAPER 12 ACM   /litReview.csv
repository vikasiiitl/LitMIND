"Numerous studies have addressed this topic with varying approaches. This paper introduces the Virtual Reality Mental Rotation Assessment (VRMRA), enhancing the assessment of spatial abilities by utilizing virtual reality technology and gamification. Validation results suggest the VRMRA offers a more accurate measure than traditional 2D tests.The paper outlines citation rules, stating that for works by more than two authors, ""et al."" should follow the first author's surname, while for two authors, their names should be connected with ""&"". [1] Bartlett et al. designed the Virtual Reality Mental Rotation Assessment (VRMRA) to evaluate spatial abilities using a 3D virtual environment and hand-tracking, enhancing user engagement compared to traditional tests like MRT and PSVT:R. Validation studies reveal that VRMRA more accurately assesses mental rotation skills, identifying design flaws in conventional tests and suggesting its superiority in spatial ability evaluation [2]. Fisher et al. investigated the mental rotation abilities of men and women, comparing results with the Vandenberg and Kuse (1978) test. Research indicates that previously observed sex differences, often showing male superiority, might be artifacts of the test's stimuli like photographs and 3D models. Adjusting these stimuli can eliminate the differences, suggesting that the gap is not due to inherent spatial abilities but rather the artificial nature of the test stimuli [3]. Takahashi & Connolly investigated how binocular vision influences geometric shape perception in spatial ability tests, emphasizing its role in enhancing accuracy and speed. Their findings highlight the significant impact of depth perception on spatial reasoning skills, suggesting improvements in performance on spatial ability assessments [4]. Toth & Campbell investigated sex differences in a computerized mental rotations test (MRT), finding no performance disparities between sexes. However, eye-tracking and pupillometry analyses revealed distinct gaze patterns and varying cognitive efforts, respectively, which suggest underlying strategic and cognitive differences in how individuals engage with MRTs. These insights enhance understanding of the cognitive processes involved in mental rotation and the factors influencing performance [5]. Bors and Vigneau investigated sex differences in Mental Rotation Test (MRT) performance, finding men generally outperformed women. Despite analyzing various item types, the reasons for these differences were largely unexplained. The study also noted that these differences are not due to angular disparity, challenging the idea that they stem from mental rotation abilities alone [6]. Bartlett et al. designed the Virtual Reality Mental Rotation Assessment (VRMRA) to enhance traditional spatial ability tests like MRT and PSVT:R by using virtual reality to present 3D shapes more intuitively. The VRMRA shows a moderate negative correlation with traditional tests and suggests that VR-based assessments could provide more accurate measurements of spatial ability, addressing limitations found in conventional 2D tests. Validation studies indicate potential design issues with traditional formats and highlight VRMRA's effectiveness in assessing complex rotations and shape features [7]. Pizlo et al. discuss that binocular disparity is a secondary cue in the perception of 3D shape, emphasizing the importance of Gestalt principles, particularly Figure-Ground Organization. They suggest that overlooking these principles has led to ineffective modeling and understanding of shape and depth perception. The paper advocates for revising research approaches and modeling techniques to better incorporate these principles for more accurate perception studies [8]. Bors & Vigneau investigated sex differences in Mental Rotation Test (MRT) performance, finding men significantly outperformed women. Despite exploring various item types, the reasons for these differences remain largely unexplained. The study also indicated that these differences might not primarily involve mental object rotation, as they are not linked to angular disparity [9]. The Revised PSVT:R, designed for first-year engineering students, accurately measures a unidimensional subcomponent of spatial ability, particularly for those with average or below-average skills. With a Cronbach's alpha of 0.84, it demonstrates high internal consistency and moderate correlations with other aptitude tests, confirming its validity and reliability. The study involved 2400 participants from a large Midwestern university, establishing the PSVT:R as a psychometrically sound tool for assessing spatial visualization skills [10]. Jianping Yue et al. investigated the effectiveness of spatial visualization tests in engineering education, focusing on isometric drawings. The study compared three test formats—developments, rotations, and isometric views—and identified common errors in isometric drawings. Recommendations were made to improve test accuracy and effectiveness in teaching spatial visualization skills, crucial in technical fields. The paper emphasizes the importance of accurate isometric drawings despite their simplicity and balanced representation of 3D objects [11]. Caissie et al. investigated the Mental Rotation Test (MRT), finding that occlusion and configuration type significantly influence item difficulty, with occluded items being the most challenging. Angular disparity showed no significant effect. A model incorporating occlusion and configuration type accounted for 53% of the variance in difficulty, indicating that basic figure perception and comparison are key factors in MRT performance [12]."
