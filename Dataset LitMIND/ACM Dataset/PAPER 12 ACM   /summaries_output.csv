2,researchers have been able to assess the mental rotation ability of men and women using the mental rotation test . the tests results have been compared to the Vandenberg and Kuse (1978) Mental Rotations Test .,"Sex differences in mental rotation ability, measured by the Vandenberg and Kuse test, have been attributed to male superiority. However, using photographs and 3D models, it has been shown that the form of stimuli eliminates sex differences. This suggests that the observed difference is not due to inherent spatial ability, but an artifact of the artificial stimuli used in the test.","Research reveals that the observed sex differences in mental rotation abilities, often measured by the Vandenberg and Kuse Mental Rotations Test and showing higher scores for men, may not reflect true gender disparities in spatial skills. Instead, these differences could be artifacts influenced by the test's stimuli, such as photographs and three-dimensional models, which when modified, can eliminate the observed sex differences. This suggests the need to reconsider the assessment methods used in evaluating spatial abilities.","Sex differences in mental rotation ability, often attributed to male superiority, are challenged by research showing that the stimuli used in assessments can eliminate this gap. By using photographs and 3D models, researchers demonstrate that the perceived advantage is not due to inherent spatial ability differences but rather a result of stimulus artificiality.","Sex Differences in Mental Rotation Ability Are a Consequence of Procedure and Artificiality of StimuliMental rotation is a cognitive process that involves performing rotations on visual images or objects, which has played a significant role in humansâ€™"
