In this paper a side channel and ISA independent method to recover the opcode from the observed memory traces is presented. The method consists of two steps: 1) candidates are filtered to match the target instruction opcode, 2) these candidates are ranked based on either a time or frequency domain side channel. In traditional disassembler approaches, the candidates are filtered based on the instruction semantics and the instruction opcode is predicted with the highest ranked candidate. In our approach, the opcode is predicted with the lowest ranked candidate. Specifically, the time and frequency domain side channels are leveraged to identify the instruction opcode that took the longest or has the lowest frequency among the candidates. This approach is shown to improve the opcode prediction accuracy, as shown by experimental results on four different CPU architectures.","The text discusses the development of a disassembler utilizing side-channel analysis, focusing on extracting executable code structures by observing indirect system behaviors, enhancing cybersecurity measures against obfuscated code threats.","Summary: The research introduces a novel approach of constructing a disassembler using side-channel information, offering a unique perspective on disassembly techniques.
