0,"Weghenkel et al. present a novel disassembler method using side-channel analysis to improve opcode prediction from memory traces, enhancing reverse engineering and cybersecurity [1]."
1,"Vaidyan and Tyagi investigated the use of electromagnetic (EM) side-channel for instruction-level disassembly in IoT networks, achieving 99% accuracy with machine learning models such as SVM and CNN, and feature selection via PCA, enhancing security and malware analysis [2]."
2,"Iyer et al. propose a low-cost electromagnetic side-channel disassembler that predicts program execution traces with high accuracy using a hierarchical classification method. This method involves feature selection and classification, achieving 97-99% instruction recovery from test programs without extensive profiling [3]."
3,"Van Geest & Buhan developed a machine learning-based side-channel disassembler for ARM-Cortex M0, achieving up to 99% accuracy in extracting instructions from power traces and highlighted effective data preparation and noise reduction techniques [4]."
4,"The provided text lacks the abstract or detailed content of Cristiani et al.'s research paper, focusing instead on repository and bibliographic details. Access to the full document is necessary for a comprehensive summary [5]."
5,"Park et al. proposed a power-based side-channel instruction-level disassembler for real-time monitoring of embedded systems, utilizing machine learning to achieve over 99% accuracy in identifying executed instructions, enhancing security against malware [6]."
6,"Strobel et al. discuss SCANDALee, a side-channel analysis technique that uses electromagnetic emanations to extract code from embedded systems with over 95% accuracy. This method, employing supervised learning, is practical for cryptography, security, and reverse engineering applications [7]."
