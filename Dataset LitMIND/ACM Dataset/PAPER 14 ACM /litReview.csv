"Previous research highlights significant advances in reporting quality for systematic reviews (SRs) in human-computer interaction (HCI), revealing the need for enhanced protocols and methods, particularly within CHI conference submissions. This study provides guiding questions and best practices, applying PRISMA and ENTREQ guidelines to improve SR reporting and execution.Rogers et al. conducted an umbrella review on the reporting quality of CHI systematic reviews, revealing poor adherence to PRISMA and ENTREQ guidelines. The study identifies areas needing improvement in appraisal, synthesis, and documentation, and provides best practices for HCI researchers [1]. Oulasvirta & Hornb√¶k present HCI research as problem-solving, based on Laudan's philosophy, categorizing problems into empirical, conceptual, and constructive types. They advocate assessing progress by problem-solving capacity, promoting a unified approach to HCI [2]. Rogers et al. investigate the reporting quality of systematic reviews (SRs) in HCI, highlighting inadequate documentation and areas for improvement. The study uses PRISMA and ENTREQ guidelines to suggest best practices and guiding questions for enhancing SR transparency and quality in HCI [3]. Chalmers et al. discussed the evolution of research synthesis from narrative reviews to systematic reviews and meta-analyses, highlighting increased rigor and transparency in evidence-based decision-making across various fields [4]. Faulkner et al. discuss umbrella reviews, which synthesize evidence from multiple reviews into a comprehensive summary, enhancing understanding and providing a higher level of evidence on intervention effectiveness [5]."
