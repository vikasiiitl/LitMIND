1,"a meta-scientific account of human-computer interaction (HCI) research as problem-solving is presented in this essay . it builds on the philosophy of Larry Laudan,","HCI research is viewed as problem-solving, encompassing empirical, conceptual, and constructive problems. Progress is assessed based on problem-solving capacity, rather than validity or methodology. This perspective unifies HCI disciplines and encourages collaboration to advance our ability to solve problems in human-computer interaction.","This essay presents a meta-scientific view of HCI research through the lens of problem-solving, drawing on Larry Laudan's philosophy. It categorizes HCI problems into empirical, conceptual, and constructive types, advocating for evaluating research based on its problem-solving capacity, promoting a unified, discipline-free approach to HCI.","This essay presents HCI research as problem-solving, drawing on Laudan's philosophy. It identifies three main problem types: empirical, conceptual, and constructive. Emphasizing problem-solving capacity as a universal criterion, it advocates for advancing solutions to enhance computer use, offering a unified perspective on HCI.",HCI Research as Problem-SolvingABSTRACTThis essay contributes a meta-scientific account of human-computer interaction (HCI) research as problem-solving.
