0,"Sakib et al. discuss a novel scientific paper recommendation system that uses collaborative filtering and public citation contexts, overcoming the limitations of previous systems reliant on non-public data and user profiles. This approach utilizes two-level paper-citation relations to uncover hidden associations between papers, significantly enhancing precision, recall, and other metrics. It allows researchers to discover relevant publications regardless of their research background, demonstrating superior performance over traditional models. [1]"
1,"Degha and Laallam developed ICA-CRMAS, an intelligent citation recommendation system that utilizes deep learning, semantic analysis, and multimodal learning. It enhances citation accuracy by incorporating contextual data from academic papers, including figures, and provides personalized, relevant suggestions with clear explanations. The system significantly outperforms existing models in accuracy, diversity, and user satisfaction, as confirmed by robust evaluations [2]."
2,"Ebesu & Fang developed the Neural Citation Network (NCN), which enhances citation recommendations by employing a sophisticated encoder-decoder architecture with a max time delay neural network, attention mechanisms, and author networks. This system robustly represents citation contexts and significantly outperforms competitive baselines on the CiteSeer dataset, indicating a promising direction for future research in context-aware citation recommendation [3]."
3,"Guo et al. proposed a Content-Sensitive Citation Representation (CSCR) approach to address data sparsity and high dimensionality in bibliographic networks, enhancing citation recommendation systems. Utilizing Doc2vec for generating paper embeddings and modifying network structures, CSCR significantly outperforms benchmarks in metrics like NDCG and Recall, effectively improving citation recommendations for researchers [4]."
4,"Meilian et al. propose the AHITS-UPT method, an advanced academic resource recommendation system combining the AHITS algorithm and a User-Paper-Topic (UPT) model to evaluate resource quality and user interests. This method addresses the shortcomings of existing content-based approaches by enhancing recommendation accuracy and expanding user perspectives. Experimental results confirm its effectiveness in improving both the accuracy and efficiency of academic resource recommendations [5]."
5,"Hui et al. propose a novel hybrid paper recommendation method, AMHG, which utilizes a multi-level heterogeneous graph to capture semantic relationships and incorporates metadata to enhance academic paper recommendations. This approach addresses the cold start problem by considering authors' influence and similar authorship, showing superior performance over traditional models in experiments on the DBLP-REC dataset. AMHG effectively manages the information overload in digital libraries, outperforming existing methods that rely on simple citation networks [6]."
6,"Bhagavatula et al. propose a content-based citation recommendation method that embeds academic paper drafts into vector spaces, identifying and re-ranking nearest neighbor candidates without relying on metadata. This approach, which outperforms existing models by up to 22% on key metrics, avoids metadata-induced biases and enhances fairness in citation practices. The method shows significant improvements on PubMed and DBLP datasets and includes the release of an online portal and a new dataset, OpenCorpus, for further research [7]."
7,"Pham et al. introduce a novel graph-based topic modeling method to identify irrelevant citations in academic texts. This approach utilizes graph structures to enhance the accuracy of citation relevance assessment, thereby potentially improving the quality and integrity of scholarly publications [8]."
8,"Ma & Wang proposed HGRec, a personalized paper recommendation method using a heterogeneous graph representation to enhance the accuracy of recommendations in academic networks. By constructing detailed author and paper profiles and employing meta-path based proximity measures to update node embeddings, HGRec effectively personalizes paper recommendations. Experiments on the DBLP network demonstrate its superior performance over existing methods [9]."
9,"FÃ¤rber & Jatowt discuss citation recommendation, highlighting its importance due to the increasing volume of scientific publications. They provide an overview of approaches, datasets, and evaluation methods for recommending citations, noting the lack of comprehensive surveys in this area. The article emphasizes the relevance of these insights not only for scientific texts but also for other document types like news articles. Challenges and commonalities in citation recommendation are also explored [10]."
10,"Liu et al. introduced a novel citation recommendation method using easily obtainable citation relations and association mining to compute similarities between citing papers for collaborative filtering. This context-based approach addresses information overload in academia by enhancing the accuracy of automatic reference suggestions. Experiments demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms baseline methods in precision, recall, F1 score, mean average precision, and mean reciprocal rank on real-world datasets [11]."
11,"Lee et al. developed a personalized academic paper recommendation system that uses social media relationships and collaborative filtering to suggest relevant articles to researchers, effectively reducing their workload. The system's effectiveness in recommending suitable research papers has been confirmed through computational evaluations and user studies, demonstrating its utility in managing the growing volume of academic publications [12]."
12,"Kieu et al. proposed a novel citation recommendation approach that combines deep sequential representations, specifically Sentence-BERT, with Siamese and triplet networks, and a submodular scoring function. This method significantly outperforms existing methods on the ACL Anthology Network corpus across all metrics, including MRR and F1@k scores, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing document representations for automated citation selection [13]."
