Trained on a massive dataset of 7.5 billion examples, PinSage outperforms existing deep learning and graph-based methods, delivering higher-quality recommendations and advancing scalable web-scale recommender systems. This represents a significant application of deep graph embeddings in handling billions of items and users [1]. Meir et al. propose a market-inspired bidding scheme for assigning paper reviews at academic conferences, where reviewers are given budgets and papers are priced based on demand. This system incentivizes reviewers to bid sincerely, aiming to secure their preferred papers. Simulations using real conference data show that this approach leads to better bid distribution and more effective paper assignments compared to traditional methods [2]. Zhang et al. discuss ApeGNN, a graph neural network that introduces node-wise adaptive aggregation for recommendation systems. This method allows each node to adjust its diffusion weights based on local structures, significantly enhancing recommendation accuracy. ApeGNN outperforms existing GNN-based methods by up to 48.94% across various datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of adaptive aggregation in improving recommendation performance [3]. Yi et al. introduced FourierGNN, a novel graph neural network that redefines multivariate time series forecasting by integrating spatial and temporal dynamics into a unified model called the hypervariate graph. This approach utilizes the Fourier Graph Operator for efficient matrix multiplications in Fourier space, enhancing expressiveness and reducing complexity. FourierGNN not only simplifies computations but also significantly improves forecasting accuracy, outperforming traditional methods in empirical evaluations across multiple datasets. Its effectiveness is further supported by its theoretical equivalence to graph convolutions [4]. Kobren et al. propose a novel local fairness formulation to address critical issues in paper matching during peer reviews, such as reviewer expertise sufficiency and workload balance. They introduce two algorithms, FairIr and FairFlow; FairIr ensures maximal objective achievement with minimal fairness compromise, while FairFlow balances efficiency and fairness, both demonstrating improved outcomes on real conference data [5]. Nihar B. Shah's WSDM 2021 tutorial explores systemic challenges in peer review, such as bias, subjectivity, and dishonesty, exacerbated by increasing submission volumes. It presents computational solutions and experiments aimed at improving fairness and credibility in peer review, with a focus on providing equitable opportunities for all researchers. The tutorial emphasizes the significant potential impact of resolving these issues on the academic community [6]. Wang et al. survey automatic approaches to the Reviewer Assignment Problem (RAP) in academic peer-review, crucial for maintaining publication quality. They divide RAP into three interconnected phases: reviewer search, matching computation, and assignment optimization. The survey highlights current research focusing mainly on individual phases and identifies gaps, suggesting future research opportunities in integrated and online optimization across disciplines like AI and operations research [7]. Zhao and Zhang provide a detailed review of reviewer assignment algorithms from 1992 to 2022, discussing the development and optimization of these systems for peer review automation. They cover the construction of reviewer databases, computation of matching degrees, and algorithm optimization, highlighting their importance for fair and accurate peer reviews. The survey also addresses evaluation metrics, datasets, and future research directions, serving as a resource for researchers and organizers [8]. Balog et al. discuss two generative probabilistic models for identifying experts within enterprise document repositories. The first model directly links experts to documents, while the second locates topical documents before identifying relevant experts. Evaluations on the TREC Enterprise corpus reveal that the second model outperforms the first and other unsupervised methods in expert finding. [9] Jecmen et al. developed a randomized algorithm to optimally solve the reviewer-assignment problem in peer review, effectively reducing manipulation such as malicious reviewer assignments, torpedo reviewing, and reviewer de-anonymization. The algorithm limits the probability of a malicious reviewer being assigned to a desired paper to 50%, while maintaining high assignment quality. Experimental evaluations confirm the algorithm's effectiveness in mitigating biased reviews and achieving over 90% optimal similarity in reviewer-paper assignments [10]. Mu et al. proposed a novel approach, Knowledge-Guided Disentangled Representation Learning (KDR), which utilizes knowledge graphs (KG) to enhance the interpretability and address data sparsity in recommender systems. KDR aligns implicit disentangled representations from user-item interactions with explicit representations from KGs, improving recommendation performance and understanding of user preferences. The effectiveness of KDR is validated through experiments on real-world datasets [11]. Protasiewicz et al. discussed a recommender system for reviewers and experts in reviewing problems.

Additional sections are required for a detailed summary of the key findings and contributions [12]. Shah et al. proposed a rule-based approach, SAFE, for extracting app features from user reviews. An external replication study revealed that SAFE had lower precision and recall than initially reported, with performance influenced by the feature density in review datasets. The study used multiple datasets and an accurate implementation of SAFE, emphasizing the need for objective and reproducible research methods in evaluating such approaches [13]. Yu et al. propose a socially-aware self-supervised learning framework that enhances recommender systems by integrating user social information and utilizing tri-training. This method employs three graph encoders to capture self-supervision signals from multiple views, iteratively refining user representations. Extensive real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of this approach in improving recommendation accuracy [14]. MA et al. developed KR-GCN, a novel knowledge-aware recommendation method that integrates knowledge graphs with graph convolution networks to enhance recommender systems. This approach addresses challenges of error propagation and weak explainability by employing a transition-based scoring system, nucleus sampling for path selection, and a path-level self-attention mechanism. Experiments demonstrate KR-GCN's superior performance in improving recommendation accuracy and explanation quality [15]. Fang et al. propose a relevance-based discriminative learning framework for expert search, which integrates document evidence and document-candidate associations, outperforming generative models. This framework eliminates the need for additional modeling assumptions and has been validated through extensive testing on TREC Enterprise track corpora, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in enhancing expert search methodologies [16]. Jin et al. proposed NIRec, an efficient neighborhood-based interaction model for recommendation on heterogeneous graphs, utilizing a convolutional approach and fast Fourier transform.
