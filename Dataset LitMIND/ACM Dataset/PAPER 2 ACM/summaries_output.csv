4,social media data provides a complementary source for consumer behavior analysis . most studies employ time-consuming content analysis or lexical sentiment analysis . but transfer learning method is used to explore public,"Using transfer learning, researchers analyzed social media data to understand Chinese public attitudes toward alternative meat (AM). They found that about 42% of posts expressed personal feelings towards AM, with 48% positive, 23% neutral, and 29% negative. This contradicts previous studies suggesting over half of Chinese people are positive towards AM. The study highlights factors influencing AM acceptance and identifies conspiracy theories as a reason for opposition. Tofu, a traditional vegetarian substitute, was found to hinder AM acceptance due to similarities.","This study utilizes transfer learning to analyze social media data in China, revealing public attitudes towards alternative meat (AM).
