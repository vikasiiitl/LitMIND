0,"Gao et al. discussed vulnerabilities in machine learning-based anti-phishing models at MLSEC 2022, where obfuscation techniques were used to evade detection, securing third place and underscoring the need for enhanced robustness in these detectors [1]."
1,"Gao et al. demonstrated at MLSEC2022 that obfuscation techniques can manipulate phishing website source code to evade anti-phishing models, using a benign overlap strategy. Their method, which placed third, highlights vulnerabilities and suggests improvements for anti-phishing detectors [2]."
2,"Apruzzese et al. discuss the early-stage deployment of ML in cybersecurity, emphasizing its potential and challenges. The article highlights the need for better understanding and integration of ML to fully leverage its capabilities in cybersecurity, underscoring the role of stakeholders in this advancement [3]."
3,"XIANG et al. discuss CANTINA+, a ML framework for detecting phishing websites, which utilizes a rich feature set, including eight novel features, to achieve over 90% true positive rates and significantly reduce false positives [4]."
4,"Zhang et al. investigated client-side cloaking in phishing websites using the CrawlPhish framework over 14 months, detecting cloaking in 35,067 of 112,005 sites. They categorized cloaking into eight types across three categories and demonstrated the effectiveness of these techniques in evading detection [5]."
5,"Abdelnabi et al. introduced VisualPhishNet, a novel phishing detection framework using a triplet Convolutional Neural Network. It leverages the VisualPhish dataset, significantly outperforming existing methods in detecting phishing websites and demonstrating robustness against evasion attacks [6]."
6,"Peng et al. investigated VirusTotal and its 68 vendors' labeling process for phishing URLs, finding significant discrepancies in detection rates and updates. The study highlights the need for more rigorous methodologies to assess and utilize VirusTotal labels effectively [7]."
7,"Liang et al. investigated the security of client-side classifiers, revealing vulnerabilities in Google's Phishing Pages Filter (GPPF). By cracking GPPF's model, they exposed significant risks, demonstrating how phishing pages evaded detection [8]."
8,"Apruzzese et al. investigate adversarial attacks on machine-learning classifiers in security systems, focusing on poisoning and evasion. They highlight significant vulnerabilities in current defenses against malware, spam, and intrusion detection, proposing new strategies to enhance robustness [9]."
9,"Biggio et al. investigated the use of a gradient-based approach to evaluate machine learning security, particularly against evasion attacks. This method assesses classifier performance by simulating various attack scenarios, revealing vulnerabilities in malware detection systems and suggesting countermeasures [10]."
10,"Carroll et al. discuss the introduction of ""evasion-space"" to evaluate adversarial attacks on Phishing Website Detectors using machine learning, revealing significant vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of evasion attacks on these systems [11]."
