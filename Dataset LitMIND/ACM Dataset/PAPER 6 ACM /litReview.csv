"Recent research in information security has tackled improving automated labeling for ATT&CK tactics in malware threat reports. The study explores using simple feature selection techniques in NLP, revealing a 6% increase in F.5-score over prior methods, emphasizing their effectiveness over complex word embedding methods for identifying malware behaviors despite varied terminology.Zheng et al. investigated feature selection metrics for text categorization, particularly on imbalanced data. They proposed a framework that combines positive and negative features, enhancing classification accuracy using methods like multinomial na√Øve Bayes and logistic regression [1]. Legoy et al. discuss the development of rcATT, a tool that automates the extraction of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) from cyber threat reports using the MITRE ATT&CK framework, aimed at enhancing cybersecurity defenses [2]. Domschot et al. investigate automating malware labeling in threat reports, addressing inconsistent terminology and the scarcity of behavior-labeled datasets. They propose a natural language processing system to standardize descriptions and enhance novel malware detection [3]. Ampel et al. designed the CVE Transformer model, integrating the CVE list with the MITRE ATT&CK framework to enhance cybersecurity mitigation strategies. This model uses a self-distillation approach with the RoBERTa language model, significantly improving F1-score performance [4]. Domschot et al. propose automating the labeling of malware behaviors using ATT&CK to standardize descriptions and improve detection across varying terminologies in threat reports, addressing inconsistencies and facilitating novel malware detection [5]. Andrew et al. investigated mapping Linux shell commands to MITRE ATT&CK using NLP techniques such as Bag of Words and TF-IDF. They employed cosine similarity and recall metrics to assess the alignment of commands with ATT&CK tactics and sub-techniques [6]. Lim et al. introduced MalwareTextDB, a new database containing 39 annotated APT reports and 6,819 sentences, utilizing MAEC vocabulary to support NLP and cybersecurity research, aiding in data analytics and model construction [7]. Kuppa et al. introduce a Multi-Head Joint Embedding Neural Network model with unsupervised labeling to map 62,000 CVEs to 37 ATT&CK techniques, enhancing vulnerability assessments and prioritization [8]."
