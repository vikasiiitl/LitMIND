"The article introduces the ""Vice Versa Virtual Reality Algorithm,"" designed to enhance user experience by analyzing visitor behavior in VR environments. Utilizing data from 171 global visitors at the Virtual Museum of the Civic Art Gallery of Ascoli Piceno, Italy, the algorithm maps user interest primarily onto artworks, aiding in the development of more tailored virtual tours and cultural offerings. This approach not only improves virtual visits but also supports future recommender system development.Fanini & Cinque's PRISMIN framework uses image-based encoding to efficiently capture, exchange, and manipulate immersive VR sessions, enhancing remote learning and interaction analysis. It addresses data transport and decoding challenges, providing a novel approach for optimizing VR environments [1]. Pierdicca et al. discuss the growing significance of virtual tours, particularly highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, across sectors like tourism and education. They propose a standardized data layer and an analytics tool to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual tours, exemplified by a university case study [2].
