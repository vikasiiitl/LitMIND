[2] Chen et al. introduced NARRE, a neural attentional rating regression model, to enhance recommendation systems by identifying and leveraging useful reviews, thereby improving accuracy and aiding user decisions. NARRE outperforms traditional methods in evaluations. [3] Jakob et al. investigated opinion mining from user reviews to improve movie recommendation accuracy. Three methods with varying manual effort extract movie aspects, significantly outperforming traditional ratings and genres in collaborative filtering.

It addresses data sparsity and outperforms traditional recommendation systems by integrating parallel neural networks through a shared layer [17]. Atas et al. discuss how user preferences in recommender systems are dynamic and influenced by psychological factors like personality, emotions, and cognitive biases. The article explores preference construction and related research, addressing cognitive bias mitigation strategies [18].
