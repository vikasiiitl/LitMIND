"This study introduces BERT2D, a novel BERT-based model enhancing NLP for morphologically rich languages like Turkish through a two-dimensional positional embedding system, significantly outperforming existing models in various tasks.Su et al. discuss RoFormer, an enhanced transformer model with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which effectively uses positional information for dependency modeling. RoPE utilizes a rotation matrix and relative positioning in self-attention, showing superior performance in long text classification benchmarks [1]. Ke et al. propose Transformer with Untied Positional Encoding (TUPE), a novel method enhancing language pre-training models like BERT by separating word and positional correlations in self-attention, improving expressiveness and effectiveness, as evidenced by GLUE benchmark results [2]. Kaya & Tantug investigated two-dimensional positional embeddings, introducing BERT2D, which enhances performance in Turkish NLP tasks. BERT2D outperforms models like BERTurk by effectively handling complex morphologies in text classification, token classification, and question-answering, suggesting potential for other morphologically rich languages [3]. Chen et al. proposed a novel method for named entity recognition in the Chinese power marketing domain, combining whole word masking, dual feature extraction, RoBERTa, and CRF, achieving an F1 score of 88.58%, surpassing previous methods [4]. Dai et al. investigated the effectiveness of whole word masking (WWM) for Chinese BERT, finding that WWM enhances context understanding in multi-character scenarios, whereas character-level masking (CLM) is superior for single characters. Combining both strategies yields comparable results on downstream tasks [5]. Chi et al. proposed KERPLE, a novel framework that kernelizes relative positional embeddings using conditionally positive definite kernels for length extrapolation in language models. This approach maintains the efficacy of self-attention and enhances extrapolation performance across major datasets [6]. Haviv et al. discuss that transformer language models like GPT-3 can learn positional information without explicit positional encodings through causal attention mechanisms, showing competitive performance [7]. BalkÄ± Gemirter & Goularas developed a Turkish Question Answering system using deep learning and BERT, effectively handling banking-related queries and adaptable to other languages and NLP tasks, demonstrating superior performance over existing systems [8]. Cui et al. proposed a new strategy using whole word masking for Chinese BERT and introduced MacBERT, which employs a novel MLM as Correction (Mac) masking strategy. Extensive experiments on ten Chinese NLP tasks demonstrated MacBERT's superior performance, with the models open-sourced for community use [9]. Wang et al. introduce complex embeddings to encode word order in neural networks, enhancing text classification, machine translation, and language modeling by modeling word positions and their relational order, showing improvements over traditional methods [10]. Wang et al. enhanced self-attention networks (SANs) by incorporating structural position representations from dependency trees, improving word position encoding and translation task performance in Chinese-English and English-German [11]. Liu et al. propose a Chinese Named Entity Recognition (NER) model using BERT with Whole Word Masking, BiLSTM, and CRF, which enhances performance by addressing partial word issues and outperforms BERT, ELMo, and Word2Vec in experiments [12]. Chan et al. developed GBERT and GELECTRA, German language models based on BERT and ELECTRA, optimizing training data, model size, and Whole Word Masking. These models achieved superior performance in document classification and named entity recognition, outperforming existing German models and will be publicly released [13]. Press et al. introduced Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi), a position representation method in transformer models that biases query-key attention scores based on distance. This allows efficient extrapolation to longer input sequences than seen during training, improving efficiency and performance on the WikiText-103 benchmark [14]. Xu et al. discuss how self-attention models, effective in sequential modeling for NLP, lack temporal pattern recognition, focusing solely on event sequences. They introduce a functional time representation and time kernel function to enhance modeling by embedding time spans, improving interaction capture between time and events, and outperforming traditional models in real-world applications [15]. Huang et al. review and compare position embedding methods in Transformer models, introducing a novel multiplicative embedding that enhances RoBERTa models' accuracy on SQuAD datasets, outperforming traditional methods [16]. The paper by Zeng & Li titled ""Analyzing the Effect of Masking Length Distribution of MLM"" was retracted due to evidence of systematic manipulation in the publication and peer-review processes, compromising its integrity and reliability [17]. Raffel et al. introduce a unified text-to-text transformer framework in NLP, systematically comparing transfer learning techniques and achieving state-of-the-art results across various tasks. They release all resources to further NLP research [18]."
