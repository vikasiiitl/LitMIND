"In recent years, as the growing field of deep learning-based language models continues to evolve, the study introduces SciDeBERTa and SciDeBERTa(CS), specialized pre-trained models for the science technology domain. These models outperform existing science specialized models in tasks like entity recognition and demonstrate improved performance through domain-specific pretraining and fine-tuning techniques.Yang et al. introduced XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that models bidirectional contexts, overcoming BERT's limitations. By maximizing expected likelihood across all factorization permutations and integrating ideas from Transformer-XL, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, including question answering and sentiment analysis, achieving state-of-the-art results [1]. Loy et al. introduced S2ORC, a vast corpus of 81.1 million English academic papers featuring rich metadata, abstracts, resolved references, and structured full text for 8.1 million open access papers. It is the largest publicly available machine-readable academic text collection, designed to support text mining research and tool development [2]. Joshi et al. introduced SpanBERT, a pre-training method that masks contiguous spans rather than individual tokens, enhancing BERT's performance. It achieves superior results in span-based tasks like question answering and coreference resolution, with high F1 scores on SQuAD and OntoNotes, surpassing BERT and setting new benchmarks [3]. Radford et al. demonstrated that generative pre-training, followed by task-aware fine-tuning, significantly enhances natural language understanding. This approach, tested on diverse tasks like commonsense reasoning, question answering, and textual entailment, achieves state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 12 benchmarks, outperforming task-specific models [4]. Jeong & Kim proposed SciDeBERTa and SciDeBERTa(CS), pre-trained language models specialized for science and technology. These models outperform existing ones like SciBERT, excelling in entity recognition and relation extraction tasks on datasets such as SciERC and Genia, underscoring the importance of domain-specific pre-training [5]. Beltagy et al. introduced SCIBERT, a pre-trained language model based on BERT, for scientific text. It uses unsupervised pretraining on a large corpus to address the scarcity of labeled data, achieving state-of-the-art results in tasks like sequence tagging and sentence classification, outperforming BERT [6]. Chalkidis et al. investigate the adaptation of BERT for legal tasks, introducing LEGAL-BERT, a set of models designed for legal NLP. The study challenges standard pre-training and fine-tuning practices, advocating for domain-specific strategies and broader hyper-parameter tuning to optimize BERT models for legal applications [7]. Gu et al. demonstrate that pretraining language models from scratch on a large biomedical corpus outperforms continual pretraining of general-domain models on biomedical NLP tasks. They introduce BLURB, a benchmark showing state-of-the-art performance, and release pretrained models to advance research in this domain [8]. The Transformer model by Vaswani et al., based solely on attention mechanisms, surpasses traditional recurrent and convolutional models in sequence transduction tasks. It achieves superior translation quality with BLEU scores of 28.4 for English-to-German and 41.0 for English-to-French, while reducing training time and enhancing parallelizability [9]. Lee et al. introduced BioBERT, a domain-specific model pre-trained on large biomedical corpora, enhancing tasks like named entity recognition, relation extraction, and question answering. It outperforms BERT by addressing word distribution shifts, improving understanding of complex biomedical texts. Pre-trained weights and source code are accessible for researchers [10]. StructBERT, introduced by Wang et al., enhances BERT by integrating language structures in pre-training through auxiliary tasks focused on word and sentence order. This results in state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like GLUE and SQuAD, significantly improving natural language understanding tasks [11]. Mohiuddin & Mago demonstrated that tweetBERT, a language model pre-trained on Twitter data, outperforms traditional BERT models by over 7% in Twitter text mining tasks. This study underscores the importance of domain-specific models for social media analysis, highlighting the benefits of tailored language representation models. [12] Jeong & Kim propose SciDeBERTa and SciDeBERTa(CS) as specialized pre-trained language models for the science technology domain. These models outperform SciBERT and S2ORC-SciBERT in entity recognition and relation extraction tasks on datasets like SciERC and Genia, achieving significant improvements in domain-specific language understanding [13]. Sun et al. proposed ERNIE 2.0, a continual pre-training framework that enhances language understanding by capturing lexical, syntactic, and semantic information. It outperforms models like BERT and XLNet on 16 tasks, including GLUE benchmarks. The model and code are accessible on GitHub for further exploration [14]."
